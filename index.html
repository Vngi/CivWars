                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>Host whispers each player a role. Players will read the sticky to find out more about their role. When the host is finished whispering roles, the host will call "ROLES" with the newly dimmed lights. The sticky states each role's ability and how to use that ability (Whisper host your action alongside a player's name to use it on them). Example: Murder Method. The Host will then announce what has happened. Example: Method has been murdered. Then the host will announce that it's time to take votes. The players then vote on who they'd like to get out of the game.</p>

                <h3>How to Play Civilization Wars</h3>
                <p>12 players will be divided into two teams, civilians and mafia. Each member will receive a role with unique abilities. Every night, players will be able to use their ability to gain advantages in the game. Each morning, the host will announce who was murdered at night, alongside anything else that happened that night. Once votes take place, players will then whisper to the host who they think is on the opposite team. The player who receives the most votes will be out. Once all/almost all members of the opposite team have died, your team wins the game. If a player exposes other roles aloud, they will be kicked.</p>
